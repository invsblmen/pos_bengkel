# Frontend Parity Matrix (Laravel vs Go)

Last updated: 2026-04-11
Owner: Migration Team
Purpose: Track visual and UX parity so Go-backed screens are indistinguishable from Laravel-backed screens.
This matrix measures parity of user-facing behavior and presentation, not shared component source code.

Legend:
- [x] Pass
- [~] Partial / in progress
- [ ] Not started
- [!] Blocked

## 1) Parity Criteria (Applied to Every Screen)

- C1 Layout and visual hierarchy are identical (spacing, typography, cards, tables, badges, actions).
- C2 Filters/sort/search/pagination behavior are identical.
- C3 Empty/loading/error states are identical.
- C4 Validation messages and business-rule errors are identical.
- C5 Formatting parity (date, currency, number, status labels) is identical.
- C6 Realtime behavior parity (event trigger timing, update ordering, state refresh) is identical.
- C7 Permission-based visibility and action availability are identical.
- C8 Response payload shape and field semantics are identical.

Pass rule per screen:
- A screen is considered "Parity Pass" only when C1-C8 are all [x] and side-by-side UAT is signed.

## 3) Critical Flow Checklist (Cross-Screen)

- [ ] Login -> dashboard -> navigate all migrated pages without visual jump/regression.
- [ ] Filter + sort + pagination returns identical row counts and ordering between Laravel and Go.
- [ ] Empty search results show identical state and wording.
- [ ] Business-rule failures show identical UI-friendly errors (no debug page leak).
- [ ] Currency/date formatting consistency verified in all report and transaction pages.
- [ ] Realtime updates (where enabled) have same trigger timing and no duplicate render.
- [ ] Permission matrix check: hidden/disabled actions match exactly for each role.

## 4) Evidence Required per Screen

For each screen marked pass, attach:
- Screenshot A: Laravel-backed view.
- Screenshot B: Go-backed view.
- JSON sample A/B payload snapshot.
- Test note for filter/sort/pagination parity.
- Test note for empty/loading/error state parity.
- UAT sign-off (name/date).

## 5) Weekly Gate

Week considered "frontend parity green" only when:
- 0 critical screens with [!] blocked.
- At least 3 critical screens moved to full [x] C1-C8 + UAT.
- No unresolved high-severity parity defect older than 7 days.

## 6) Notes

- Start with critical screens: Appointment Index, Service Order Index, Vehicle Index, Overall Report.
- Keep user-facing behavior identical; the GO path may use its own dedicated frontend implementation as long as parity stays aligned.
- Treat payload contract drift as parity bug, not enhancement.

### Technical Validation Snapshot (2026-04-12)

- Frontend production build: PASS (`npm run build`, exit code 0).
- Go backend test/build validation: PASS (`go test ./...` pada `go-backend`).
- Realtime GO instrumentation tersedia lintas layar prioritas (status bar/toggle/hook), namun status parity C6 tetap [ ]/[~] sampai side-by-side UAT selesai.

## 7) UAT Execution Checklist (Per Screen)

Gunakan checklist ini untuk setiap screen yang diuji side-by-side Laravel vs Go.

Pre-check:
- [ ] User role penguji ditetapkan (Admin/Kasir/Service Advisor/Owner).
- [ ] Toggle fitur dicatat (canary %, feature key, source backend aktif).
- [ ] Data sample pengujian disiapkan (normal, empty-case, error-case).

Step uji inti:
- [ ] Buka screen Laravel dan Go dengan filter default yang sama.
- [ ] Bandingkan C1 (layout/visual hierarchy) termasuk tabel, badge, action button.
- [ ] Uji C2 (filter/sort/search/pagination) pada minimal 3 variasi query.
- [ ] Uji C3 (empty/loading/error states) dengan skenario tanpa data dan request lambat.
- [ ] Uji C4 (validation/business-rule errors) dan pastikan pesan setara.
- [ ] Uji C5 (date/currency/number formatting) pada data yang sama.
- [ ] Uji C6 (realtime behavior) untuk urutan update dan no duplicate render.
- [ ] Uji C7 (permission visibility) pada minimal 2 role berbeda.
- [ ] Uji C8 (payload shape) dari network response snapshot A/B.

Evidence wajib:
- [ ] Screenshot Laravel (A) dan Go (B).
- [ ] JSON payload A/B (disamarkan jika berisi data sensitif).
- [ ] Catatan hasil per C1-C8.
- [ ] Keputusan UAT: Pass / Partial / Fail.
